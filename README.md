# elementaryOS-Fluch-theme
A small, unfinished theme for elementary OS.
Its based on the default theme of elementaryOS.
So the biggest credit goes to Daniel Fore.

Important Things todo:
 - In GTK3
  - Progressbar's
  - Scrollbar
  - remove Back/Forward-Buttons weird hover-background
  - remove all Button-hover-backgrounds of the header/titlebar
  - Edit whole Darkmode (Idea: copy whole default gtk3 and just change color)
 - In GTK2
  - Add a window-frame-border like in GTK3
  - Change the Buttons to the ones from GTK3
  - Change Dialog-window-backgroundcolor and so on
 - Assets
  - change all .svg's to a more fitting version
